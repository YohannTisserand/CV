## Yohann Tisserand

**Full Stack Developer**

French-born, I have spent all my life in France. A few days after my 36th birthday, I realised that I wanted something new, something really challenging. I took the decision to move abroad to a country I've never even visited. England. I had two goals: settle down and make one of my dream come true which was becoming a **Full-Stack Developer**. 

I take great pride in helping improve people's lives, and I like to contemplate the direct benefits of my work for them. The Tech industry allows me to conciliate that need and my passion for solving daily problems/puzzles.

<h3>Skills</h3>

**Self learner**</br>
I have always been fascinated by technology. I am convinced that can help people in their life every day. A few years ago, I wanted to find out how a website works in its foundation, I've learnt the Html and CSS basics for the purpose to build my own website. I really loved what I was doing, wanted to go further, so I installed Linux (Debian, ArchLinux) as a main OS. I had the desire to deeply understand the interaction between the user and the machine through a terminal.

<h3>Experience</h3>

2015 - 2019</br>
*Chief*</br>
Working as a chief in a French well-known restaurant. I was used to work under pressure, responsible for the daily stocks. Organization was my best friend.

2010 - 2013</br>
*Internet provider IT*</br>
Understanding and solving customer's internet issues were my daily activity. Demonstrate empathy was critical.

2007 - 2009</br>
*Administrative Assistant*</br>
I was a human lie detector. Literally. Our company was tyred specialised, I was in charge of our carrier daily report across the country and I had the opportunity to report to my final client why the goods haven't been delivered in time. A strong logical was necessary.

2001 - 2007</br>
*Commando soldier*</br>
Enrolled in the French Air Force. A high sense of righteousness and rigour required.
