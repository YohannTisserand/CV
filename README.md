<h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>

<i>I am a Full-Stack Developer, focused on producing excellent code quality. My curiosity and will to learn new things led me to the tech industry. Learned HTML / CSS / Python on my own a few years ago. I was looking for a high-quality school in order to work in that industry. I take great pride in helping to improve people's lives, and I like to contemplate the direct benefits of my work for them. The Tech industry allows me to balance that need and my passion for solving daily problems/puzzles.</i>
