## Yohann Tisserand

French born, I have spent all my life in France. A few days after my 36th birthday, I realised that I wanted something new, something really challenging. I took the decision to move abraod in a country I've never even visited. England. I had two goals : settle down and make one of my dream come true which was becoming a **Full Stack Developer**. 

I take great pride in helping improve people's life, and I like to contemplate the direct benefits of my work for them. Tech industry allow me to conciliate that need and my passion about solving daily problems/puzzles.
